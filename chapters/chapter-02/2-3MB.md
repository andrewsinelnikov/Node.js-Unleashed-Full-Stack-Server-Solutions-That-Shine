## Memory Boost: Request and Response Deep Dive

Time to lock in those Express.js essentials! Answer these quick questions to solidify what you’ve learned. No pressure—just a fun way to boost your memory!

Read each question and try to answer it mentally or jot down your response. Use the hints to jog your memory if you’re stuck. This is a great way to check your understanding before moving to the next section.

1. 🛠️ Request Object Basics<br />
   **What are `req.method`, `req.url`, and `req.params`, and what kind of data do they provide?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think about the HTTP method, the full URL, and dynamic parts of a route like `/users/:id`!)*
   
2. 📡 Query Strings<br />
   **What does `req.query` contain, and how would it look for a URL like `/search?name=John&age=30?`**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s all about those key-value pairs after the `?` in the URL!)*
   
3. 📦 Parsing JSON Data<br />
   **What does `express.json()` do, and why is it critical for handling POST requests with JSON payloads?**<br />
   *(Hint: It turns raw JSON from the client into a usable `req.body` object!)*
   
4. 📝 URL-Encoded Data<br />
   **How does `express.urlencoded({ extended: true })` help with form submissions, and what does the extended option do?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think HTML `<form>` data and whether it can handle nested objects!)*
   
5. 🍪 Cookies with cookie-parser<br />
   **What does `res.cookie('name', 'value', { maxAge: 900000 })` do, and how can you read it later with `req.cookies`?**<br />
   *(Hint: It sets a cookie for the client, and you can grab it from the request later!)*
   
6. 📤 Response Methods<br />
   **What’s the difference between `res.json()`, `res.send()`, and `res.sendFile()` in terms of what they send to the client?**<br />
   *(Hint: One’s for JSON, one’s flexible, and one sends files like PDFs!)*

7. 🔢 Status Codes<br />
   **Why would you use `res.status(201)` for a POST request and `res.status(404)` for a missing resource?**<br />
   *(Hint: Status codes tell the client if something was created or not found!)*

8. 🔒 Security with Helmet<br />
   **Why is `helmet()` included in the middleware stack?**<br />
   *(Hint: It protects your app by setting headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities!)*

9. 📜 Logging with Morgan<br />
   **What’s the benefit of using `morgan('dev')` during development?**<br />
   *(Hint: It gives you colorful, concise logs of every request to debug faster!)*

10. 🧪 Testing Routes<br />
   **How would you test if the `/users` route is working after starting the server?**<br />
   *(Hint: Start the server, then use a browser or Postman to hit `http://localhost:3000/users`!)*
