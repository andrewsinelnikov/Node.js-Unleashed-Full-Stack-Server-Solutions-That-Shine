### Express.js: What, Why, and How to Set It Up

So far, you’ve created a basic HTTP server using Node’s built-in `http` module. While it works just fine for simple use cases, as your app grows, things can get messy—fast. Imagine writing dozens of `if (req.url === '/somepath')` statements. Routing, parsing data, error handling—it all takes extra effort and code.
That’s where **Express.js** comes in.

**What is Express.js?**

Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application **framework for Node.js**. It gives you powerful tools to build web apps and APIs—without all the boilerplate code you'd need with raw Node. It wraps around Node’s built-in HTTP server, offering a cleaner and more organized way to handle routes, requests, responses, and more.Think of Express as adding power steering to your car—you still drive (Node.js), but now it’s much easier to steer and control the direction of your app.

**The Problem Express Solves (vs. Raw Node.js)**

In the Node.js Fundamentals chapter, you built a basic HTTP server using the `http` module. While functional, it required manual handling of every aspect of a request—parsing URLs, setting headers, handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), and managing responses. This approach becomes cumbersome as your application grows. For example:
- **Routing**: In raw Node.js, you used `if-else` statements to check `req.url` and handle different routes. This gets messy with many routes.
- **Middleware**: Tasks like parsing JSON bodies, handling query parameters, or logging requests require custom code or  external libraries.
- **Scalability**: Organizing a large app with raw Node.js involves manually structuring routes, error handling, and logic, which can lead to spaghetti code.
