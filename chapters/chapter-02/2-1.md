### Express.js: What, Why, and How to Set It Up

So far, you’ve created a basic HTTP server using Node’s built-in `http` module. While it works just fine for simple use cases, as your app grows, things can get messy—fast. Imagine writing dozens of `if (req.url === '/somepath')` statements. Routing, parsing data, error handling—it all takes extra effort and code.
That’s where **Express.js** comes in.

**What is Node.js?**

Node.js is **a runtime environment**—a platform that lets you run JavaScript code on the server, not just in a browser. Launched in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, it’s built on Chrome’s V8 engine, the same tech that makes your web browsing lightning-fast. What’s the big deal? You can use JavaScript—the language of dancing buttons and dynamic webpages—to handle backend tasks like saving data or processing orders. **One language**, front to back, no juggling required.

**Why It Stands Out**

Node.js is **lean and mean**. It’s designed to process thousands of requests **efficiently**, using minimal resources—no clunky overhead here. Your e-commerce store with thousands of shoppers? A task app with users adding goals like crazy? A fitness tracker logging reps in real-time? Node.js says, “Bring it on.” It’s **scalable**, too, growing from your personal project to enterprise-grade apps with ease. That’s why giants like Netflix, LinkedIn, and Uber rely on it.  Plus, its **ecosystem** of open-source libraries means tools for authentication, data parsing, or anything else are just a download away.

So, what’s the bottom line? Whether you’re building a high-performance web server, a real-time collaboration tool, or even a microservice architecture, Node.js is built to handle it all.
