## Routing, middleware, structure

Once you’ve got a basic Express server up and running, it’s time to level up. This section dives into middleware, routing, and structuring your project for growth — critical concepts for creating scalable, maintainable, and robust full-stack applications.

### What is Middleware?

In Express, middleware is any function that has access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the next middleware (`next`) in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware can execute code (e.g., logging, authentication), modify the `req` or `res` objects, end the request-response cycle (e.g., send a response), call the next middleware or route handler using `next()`.

Middleware is executed in the order it’s defined, forming a pipeline for processing requests. You can think of middleware as a series of filters or steps a request passes through before reaching a route handler or sending a response.

**Types of Middleware**
1. *Application-level middleware* - applied globally or to specific paths using `app.use()` or `app.METHOD()`.
2. *Router-level middleware* - applied to specific routes or route groups using `router.use()`.
3. *Built-in middleware* - provided by Express (e.g., `express.json()`).
4. *Third-party middleware* - external libraries (e.g., `morgan`, `helmet`).
5. *Error-handling middleware* - special middleware with four parameters to handle errors.

### Built-in Middleware

Express includes a few essential middleware functions:
- `express.json()` - parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and  req.body will automatically contain parsed JSON for POST/PUT requests.
  ```javascript
  app.use(express.json());
  ```
- `express.static()` - serves static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, images) from a specified directory. Commonly used in full-stack apps to serve a frontend build (e.g., a React or Vue app).
  ```javascript
  app.use(express.static('public'));
  ```
  Any file in the `/public` folder is now served at `http://localhost:3000/filename.ext`.

### Custom Middleware

You can write your own middleware for custom needs.  Let’s explore three common use cases: logging, error handling, and authentication.
- *Logging Middleware* - logs details about each request (e.g., method, URL, timestamp)
  ```javascript
    const logger = (req, res, next) => {
      console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
      next();
    };

    app.use(logger);
  ```
- *Error Handling Middleware* - handles errors thrown in your app. Error middleware has four arguments: (err, req, res, next):
  ```javascript
      app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
        console.error(err.stack);
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something broke!' });
      });
  ```
- *Authentication Middleware* - checks if a request is authenticated (e.g., by validating a token)
  ```javascript
      const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
        if (req.headers.authorization === 'secret-token') {
          next();
        } else {
          res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
        }
      };
  ```
  Apply to specific routes
  ```javascript
      app.get('/protected', authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
        res.send('Protected content');
      });
  ```
  In a real app, use a library like jsonwebtoken for proper token validation.

### Third-Party Middleware

Third-party middleware extends Express with additional functionality. Install these using npm and integrate them with `app.use()`. Here are three popular ones:
- `morgan` - a robust logging middleware that generates detailed request logs
   ```bash
      npm install morgan
   ```
   Usage:
   ```javascript
      const morgan = require('morgan');
      app.use(morgan('dev')); // Logs requests in 'dev' format
   ```
- `helmet` - adds security headers to protect your app from common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, clickjacking)
   ```bash
      npm install helmet
   ```
   Usage:
   ```javascript
      const helmet = require('helmet');
      app.use(helmet());
   ```
- `cors` (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) - nables CORS, allowing your API to be accessed from different domains (e.g., a    frontend on `http://localhost:3000` calling an API on `http://localhost:5000`)
   ```bash
      npm install cors
   ```
   Usage:
   ```javascript
      const cors = require('cors');
      app.use(cors());
   ```

### Route Parameters

Route parameters are placeholders in the URL, defined with a colon (`:`). They’re accessible via `req.params`:
```javascript
  app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.params.id;
    res.json({ message: `Fetching user with ID ${userId}` });
  });
```

### Query Strings

Query strings are key-value pairs in the URL (e.g., `?name=John&age=30`). They’re accessible via `req.query`:
```javascript
  app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
    const { name, age } = req.query;
    res.json({ message: `Searching for ${name}, age ${age}` });
  });
```

### `app.use()` for Modular Routes

`app.use()` mounts middleware or routes at specific paths, enabling modular routing. This is key for organizing large apps:
```javascript
  app.use('/api', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'API root' });
  });
```
All routes starting with `/api` will hit this handler. You can also mount entire routers.

**Grouping and File Structure**<br />
Stick to a scalable pattern:
```plain
my-express-app/
├── src/
│   ├── routes/        # Route definitions
│   ├── controllers/   # Business logic
│   ├── middleware/    # Reusable middleware
│   └── app.js         # Main app setup
├── server.js          # Entry point
```

For scalability, group related `routes` and separate them into different files. Use Express’s `Router` class to define route groups. `controllers` hold logic, `middleware` holds functions like `authMiddleware`, and `app.js` brings it all together.

**Creating a Router**<br />
```javascript
  // File: 'src/routes/userRoutes.js'
  const express = require('express');
  const router = express.Router();
  
  // Define routes
  router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'List all users' });
  });
  
  router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: `Get user with ID ${req.params.id}` });
  });
  
  module.exports = router;
```

**Mounting the Router**<br />
```javascript
  // File: 'src/app.js'
  const express = require('express');
  const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');
  
  const app = express();
  
  app.use(express.json());
  app.use('/users', userRoutes); // Mount user routes at /users
  
  module.exports = app;
```

**Server Entry Point**<br />
```javascript
  // File: 'server.js'
  const app = require('./src/app');
  const port = 3000;
  
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
```

### Handling 404s and Global Errors

A 404 response is sent when no route matches the request. Add a catch-all middleware at the end of your route definitions.

```javascript
  app.use((req, res) => {
    res.status(404).json({ error: 'Route not found' });
  });
```
