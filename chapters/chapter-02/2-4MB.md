## Memory Boost: In-memory CRUD & RESTful API Design

Time to lock in those Express.js essentials! Answer these quick questions to solidify what you’ve learned. No pressure—just a fun way to boost your memory!

Read each question and try to answer it mentally or jot down your response. Use the hints to jog your memory if you’re stuck. This is a great way to check your understanding before moving to the next section.

1. 🏛️ REST Principles<br />
   **What does it mean for a REST API to be stateless, and why is this important for scalability?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think about whether the server remembers client data between requests!)*
   
2. 📡 Query Strings<br />
   **What does `req.query` contain, and how would it look for a URL like `/search?name=John&age=30?`**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s all about those key-value pairs after the `?` in the URL!)*
   
3. 📦 Parsing JSON Data<br />
   **What does `express.json()` do, and why is it critical for handling POST requests with JSON payloads?**<br />
   *(Hint: It turns raw JSON from the client into a usable `req.body` object!)*
   
4. 📝 URL-Encoded Data<br />
   **How does `express.urlencoded({ extended: true })` help with form submissions, and what does the extended option do?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think HTML `<form>` data and whether it can handle nested objects!)*
   
5. 🍪 Cookies with cookie-parser<br />
   **What does `res.cookie('name', 'value', { maxAge: 900000 })` do, and how can you read it later with `req.cookies`?**<br />
   *(Hint: It sets a cookie for the client, and you can grab it from the request later!)*
   
6. 📤 Response Methods<br />
   **What’s the difference between `res.json()`, `res.send()`, and `res.sendFile()` in terms of what they send to the client?**<br />
   *(Hint: One’s for JSON, one’s flexible, and one sends files like PDFs!)*

7. 🔢 Status Codes<br />
   **Why would you use `res.status(201)` for a POST request and `res.status(404)` for a missing resource?**<br />
   *(Hint: Status codes tell the client if something was created or not found!)*

8. 🔄 Redirects<br />
   **What happens when you call `res.redirect(301, '/new-route')`, and what does the 301 mean?**<br />
   *(Hint: It sends the client somewhere else, and the number signals a permanent move!)*

9. 📄 Serving Files<br />
   **How does `res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'document.pdf'))` work, and what happens if the file doesn’t exist?**<br />
   *(Hint: It sends a file to the client, but you might need error handling for missing files!)*

10. 🗜️ Compression and Rate Limiting<br />
   **What’s the purpose of the compression and express-rate-limit middleware, and how do they benefit your app?**<br />
   *(Hint: One shrinks response sizes, and the other stops clients from overwhelming your server!)*
