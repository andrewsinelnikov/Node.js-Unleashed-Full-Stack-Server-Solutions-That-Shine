## Memory Boost: Logging, Error Handling Basics

Time to lock in those Express.js essentials! Answer these quick questions to solidify what you’ve learned. No pressure—just a fun way to boost your memory!

Read each question and try to answer it mentally or jot down your response. Use the hints to jog your memory if you’re stuck. This is a great way to check your understanding before moving to the next section.

1. 📝 Logging Basics<br />
   **What’s the purpose of logging in an Express.js application, and how does it help with debugging?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think about tracking requests, errors, or app behavior to diagnose issues!)*
   
2. 🛠️ Winston Logger<br />
   **What is the role of the Winston library, and what does the `requestLogger` middleware log for each HTTP request?**<br />
   *(Hint: Winston handles structured logging, and `requestLogger` captures method, URL, and more!)*
   
3. ⚠️ Custom Error Classes<br />
   **What’s the benefit of using a custom `AppError` class and its subclasses like `NotFoundError` and `ValidationError`?**<br />
   *(Hint: They standardize error properties like status codes and messages for consistency!)*
   
4. 🔄 Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Errors<br />
   **How does Express handle synchronous errors automatically, and what must you do to handle asynchronous errors in routes?**<br />
   *(Hint: Sync errors go to error middleware, but async needs `try/catch` or `next(err)`!)*
   
5. 🛡️ Centralized Error Middleware<br />
   **Why is a centralized error-handling middleware important, and what does it do with operational vs. unexpected errors?**<br />
   *(Hint: It avoids duplicate code and formats responses differently for known vs. unknown errors!)*
   
6. 🛡️ Validation Middleware<br />
   **What does the `validateUser` middleware check for in POST and PUT requests, and what happens if validation fails?**<br />
   *(Hint: It looks at `name` and `email`, and sends a specific error code if they’re invalid!)*

7. 🔍 Existence Check Middleware<br />
   **How does the `checkUserExists` middleware save code in GET, PUT, and DELETE routes, and what does it attach to `req.user`?**<br />
   *(Hint: It avoids repeating “user not found” checks and passes the found user to the controller!)*

8. 📡 GET Routes<br />
   **What’s the difference between `GET /users` and `GET /users/:id` in terms of what they return?**<br />
   *(Hint: One gives you a list, the other a single resource!)*

9. ✍️ POST vs. PUT<br />
   **How does a `POST /users` request differ from a `PUT /users/:id` request in terms of purpose and response?**<br />
   *(Hint: One creates a new resource, the other updates an existing one!)*

10. 🗑️ DELETE Route<br />
   **What does the `DELETE /users/:id` route do, and why might you return a `204 No Content` status instead of `200 OK`?**<br />
   *(Hint: It removes a resource, and one status code signals “nothing to return”!)*
