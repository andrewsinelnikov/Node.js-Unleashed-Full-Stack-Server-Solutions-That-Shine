## Memory Boost: Logging, Error Handling Basics

Time to lock in those Express.js essentials! Answer these quick questions to solidify what you’ve learned. No pressure—just a fun way to boost your memory!

Read each question and try to answer it mentally or jot down your response. Use the hints to jog your memory if you’re stuck. This is a great way to check your understanding before moving to the next section.

1. 🏛️ REST Principles<br />
   **What does it mean for a REST API to be stateless, and why is this important for scalability?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think about whether the server remembers client data between requests!)*
   
2. 📋 CRUD Operations<br />
   **Name the four main CRUD operations and their corresponding HTTP methods in a RESTful API.**<br />
   *(Hint: Create, Read, Update, Delete—match them to POST, GET, PUT, DELETE!)*
   
3. 🔗 Resource-Based URLs<br />
   **Why should you use `/users` instead of `/getUsers` in a RESTful API, and what’s the role of `:id` in `/users/:id`?**<br />
   *(Hint: REST loves nouns for resources, and `:id` is a dynamic placeholder!)*
   
4. ✅ Status Codes<br />
   **Why do we use `201 Created` for a POST request and `404 Not Found` when a resource isn’t available?**<br />
   *(Hint: Status codes tell the client if something was created or couldn’t be found!)*
   
5. 📚 In-memory Store<br />
   **What’s the purpose of the `users` array and `nextId` variable in our in-memory store, and what happens to the data when the server restarts?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s a fake database, but it’s not persistent!)*
   
6. 🛡️ Validation Middleware<br />
   **What does the `validateUser` middleware check for in POST and PUT requests, and what happens if validation fails?**<br />
   *(Hint: It looks at `name` and `email`, and sends a specific error code if they’re invalid!)*

7. 🔍 Existence Check Middleware<br />
   **How does the `checkUserExists` middleware save code in GET, PUT, and DELETE routes, and what does it attach to `req.user`?**<br />
   *(Hint: It avoids repeating “user not found” checks and passes the found user to the controller!)*

8. 📡 GET Routes<br />
   **What’s the difference between `GET /users` and `GET /users/:id` in terms of what they return?**<br />
   *(Hint: One gives you a list, the other a single resource!)*

9. ✍️ POST vs. PUT<br />
   **How does a `POST /users` request differ from a `PUT /users/:id` request in terms of purpose and response?**<br />
   *(Hint: One creates a new resource, the other updates an existing one!)*

10. 🗑️ DELETE Route<br />
   **What does the `DELETE /users/:id` route do, and why might you return a `204 No Content` status instead of `200 OK`?**<br />
   *(Hint: It removes a resource, and one status code signals “nothing to return”!)*
