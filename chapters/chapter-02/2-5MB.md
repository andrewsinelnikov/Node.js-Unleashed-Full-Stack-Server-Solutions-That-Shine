## Memory Boost: Logging, Error Handling Basics

Time to lock in those Express.js essentials! Answer these quick questions to solidify what you’ve learned. No pressure—just a fun way to boost your memory!

Read each question and try to answer it mentally or jot down your response. Use the hints to jog your memory if you’re stuck. This is a great way to check your understanding before moving to the next section.

1. 📝 Logging Basics<br />
   **What’s the purpose of logging in an Express.js application, and how does it help with debugging?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think about tracking requests, errors, or app behavior to diagnose issues!)*
   
2. 🛠️ Winston Logger<br />
   **What is the role of the Winston library, and what does the `requestLogger` middleware log for each HTTP request?**<br />
   *(Hint: Winston handles structured logging, and `requestLogger` captures method, URL, and more!)*
   
3. ⚠️ Custom Error Classes<br />
   **What’s the benefit of using a custom `AppError` class and its subclasses like `NotFoundError` and `ValidationError`?**<br />
   *(Hint: They standardize error properties like status codes and messages for consistency!)*
   
4. 🔄 Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Errors<br />
   **How does Express handle synchronous errors automatically, and what must you do to handle asynchronous errors in routes?**<br />
   *(Hint: Sync errors go to error middleware, but async needs `try/catch` or `next(err)`!)*
   
5. 🛡️ Centralized Error Middleware<br />
   **Why is a centralized error-handling middleware important, and what does it do with operational vs. unexpected errors?**<br />
   *(Hint: It avoids duplicate code and formats responses differently for known vs. unknown errors!)*
   
6. 📋 Error Logging<br />
   **How does the error-handling middleware use Winston to log errors, and why include details like stack trace and request path?**<br />
   *(Hint: Logs help trace errors with context for debugging, stored in files like `error.log`!)*

7. 🚫 Validation Error Handling<br />
   **How does the updated validateUser middleware use ValidationError, and what response does the client receive for invalid input?**<br />
   *(Hint: It throws a custom error, leading to a 400 response with a clear message!)*

8. 🔍 Not Found Errors<br />
   **What does the checkUserExists middleware do when a user isn’t found, and how does the error middleware handle it?**<br />
   *(Hint: It throws NotFoundError, resulting in a 404 response with “User not found”!)*

9. 📡 404 Route Handler<br />
   **How does the 404 handler in app.js work, and why does it throw a NotFoundError instead of sending a response directly?**<br />
   *(Hint: It catches unknown routes and lets the error middleware handle consistency!)*

10. 🗑️ DELETE Route<br />
   **What does the `DELETE /users/:id` route do, and why might you return a `204 No Content` status instead of `200 OK`?**<br />
   *(Hint: It removes a resource, and one status code signals “nothing to return”!)*
