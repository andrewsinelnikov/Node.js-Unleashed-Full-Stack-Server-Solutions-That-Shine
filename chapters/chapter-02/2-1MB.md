## Memory Boost: Express.js - what, why, and how to set it up

Time to lock in those Express.js essentials! Answer these quick questions to solidify what you’ve learned. No pressure—just a fun way to boost your memory!

Read each question and try to answer it mentally or jot down your response. Use the hints to jog your memory if you’re stuck. This is a great way to check your understanding before moving to the next section.

1. 🌀 The Express Advantage<br />
   **Why would you use Express instead of raw Node.js?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think cleaner routes, built-in tools, and less if-else chaos!)*
   
2. 🚗 Car Analogy<br />
   **How is Express like power steering for your Node.js server?**<br />
   *(Hint: You’re still in control, but it’s way easier to handle routes, requests, and responses!)*
   
3. 🔁 Routing Made Easy<br />
   **How does Express improve routing compared to the http module?**<br />
   *(Hint: Say goodbye to `if (req.url === '/path')` and hello to `app.get('/path', ...)`!)*
   
4. ⚙️ Middleware Mechanics<br />
   **What is middleware in Express used for?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think request logging, body parsing, and custom logic between the request and the response!)*
   
5. 🧩 Framework Face-Off<br />
   **How does Express compare to Fastify, Koa, or NestJS?**<br />
   *(Hint: Balance of simplicity, flexibility, and a huge ecosystem!)*
   
6. 📦 Setting Up Express<br />
   **What are the steps to get an Express app running from scratch?**<br />
   *(Hint: `mkdir`, `npm init`, `npm install express`, create `server.js`, then `node server.js`!)*

7. 🔥 Nodemon’s Role<br />
   **Why is nodemon useful when developing an Express app?**<br />
   *(Hint: It watches your files and restarts the server automatically—no more manual restarts!)*

8. 🗂 Suggested Folder Structure<br />
   **Why use a structured folder setup like `routes/`, `controllers/`, and `middleware/`?**<br />
   *(Hint: Better separation of concerns and easy scalability for large projects!)*

9. 🌐 Express in Full-Stack<br />
   **Where does Express sit in a full-stack app?**<br />
   *(Hint: It connects frontend requests to database actions, handles APIs, and can even serve static files!)*

10. Global Installs<br />
   **What happens when you install an npm package globally?**<br />
   *(Hint: Use `-g` with `npm install`, and it’s available across your system!)*

11. Async Support<br />
   **How do modules and npm enhance Node’s non-blocking design?**<br />
   *(Hint: They keep tasks lightweight, letting the event loop manage multiple operations!)*
