## Memory Boost: Express.js - what, why, and how to set it up

Time to lock in those Express.js essentials! Answer these quick questions to solidify what you’ve learned. No pressure—just a fun way to boost your memory!

Read each question and try to answer it mentally or jot down your response. Use the hints to jog your memory if you’re stuck. This is a great way to check your understanding before moving to the next section.

1. The Module System<br />
   **What does it mean for Node.js to use modules?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think of them as reusable pieces of code that keep your project organized and efficient!)*
   
2. Exporting Basics<br />
   **How does `module.exports` work in a Node.js file?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s how you share functions, objects, or variables with other files!)*
   
3. Importing Basics<br />
   **What’s the role of `require()` in Node.js?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s how you bring in exported code from another file or package!)*
   
4. Core Modules<br />
   **What are some built-in modules Node.js provides?**<br />
   *(Hint: Consider `fs`, `http`, `path`, and `url`—tools for common tasks!)*
   
5. Custom Modules<br />
   **Why create your own modules in Node.js?**<br />
   *(Hint: They help split your code into small, focused parts that work well with the event loop!)*
   
6. npm Overview<br />
   **What’s npm, and why is it important for Node.js?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the package manager that lets you add external libraries to your project!)*

7. Installing Packages<br />
   **How do you add a package like Express with npm?**<br />
   *(Hint: Run `npm install express`, and it’s added to `node_modules` for use!)*

8. The `package.json` File<br />
   **What’s the purpose of the `package.json` file?**<br />
   *(Hint: It stores your project’s details, dependencies, and scripts!)*

9. Using Packages<br />
   **How do you use an npm-installed package in your code?**<br />
   *(Hint: Use `require()`—like `require('express')`—to include it!)*

10. Global Installs<br />
   **What happens when you install an npm package globally?**<br />
   *(Hint: Use `-g` with `npm install`, and it’s available across your system!)*

11. Async Support<br />
   **How do modules and npm enhance Node’s non-blocking design?**<br />
   *(Hint: They keep tasks lightweight, letting the event loop manage multiple operations!)*
