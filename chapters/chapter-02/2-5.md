## Logging, Error Handling Basics

As your app grows, so does the potential for things to go wrong — bad input, broken routes, failed logic, or unexpected exceptions. Instead of letting your app crash or sending inconsistent error messages, you need a solid foundation for handling errors **gracefully** and **logging them for debugging**. That’s what this section is all about.

### Why Logging and Error Handling Matter
Errors are inevitable in any application. Without proper error handling, your app might:
* Crash when an unexpected error occurs
* Leak sensitive information in error messages
* Return inconsistent or unclear responses to clients

A solid error-handling strategy helps you:
* Keep your app running even when something breaks
* Make debugging easier
* Provide helpful, consistent feedback to users and developers

Logging, on the other hand, records requests, errors, and other events, helping you monitor and troubleshoot your application. Together, they make your API reliable and maintainable.

### Key Concepts
**Synchronous and Asynchronous Error Handling**<br />
Express handles synchronous errors (e.g., throwing an error in a route handler) automatically by passing them to the next error-handling middleware. Asynchronous errors (e.g., errors in `async` functions or Promises) require explicit handling using `try/catch` or Promise error handling to ensure they reach the error middleware.

**Custom Error Classes**<br />
Custom error classes allow you to define specific error types (e.g., `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`) with consistent properties like status codes and messages. This makes error handling more structured and reusable.

**Centralized Error-Handling Middleware**<br />
A centralized error-handling middleware catches all errors in your application, formats them consistently, and sends appropriate responses. This avoids duplicating error-handling logic across routes.

**Logging with Winston**<br />
Winston is a popular logging library for Node.js that supports customizable log levels, formats, and transports (e.g., console, file). We’ll use it to log requests and errors in a structured way.

We’ll extend the [In-memory CRUD & RESTful API Design](2-4.md) part, adding logging and error handling. Ensure your project structure includes the same `src/` folder with `controllers/`, `middleware/`, `routes/`, and `data/`. We’ll add new files for error handling and logging.

### What’s Next?

You’ve built a RESTful API with Express, implementing CRUD operations, validation, and proper route structure using an in-memory data store. In the next section, Logging and Error Handling Basics, you’ll learn how to handle errors gracefully and log requests in your Express application. We’ll introduce try/catch for async routes, set up custom error middleware, and ensure consistent error responses, laying the foundation for more advanced error handling and logging techniques later in the course.
