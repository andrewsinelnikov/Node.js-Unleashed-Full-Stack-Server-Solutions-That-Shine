## Logging, Error Handling Basics

As your app grows, so does the potential for things to go wrong — bad input, broken routes, failed logic, or unexpected exceptions. Instead of letting your app crash or sending inconsistent error messages, you need a solid foundation for handling errors **gracefully** and **logging them for debugging**. That’s what this section is all about.

### Why Logging and Error Handling Matter
Errors are inevitable in any application. Without proper error handling, your app might:
* Crash when an unexpected error occurs
* Leak sensitive information in error messages
* Return inconsistent or unclear responses to clients

### What’s Next?

You’ve built a RESTful API with Express, implementing CRUD operations, validation, and proper route structure using an in-memory data store. In the next section, Logging and Error Handling Basics, you’ll learn how to handle errors gracefully and log requests in your Express application. We’ll introduce try/catch for async routes, set up custom error middleware, and ensure consistent error responses, laying the foundation for more advanced error handling and logging techniques later in the course.
