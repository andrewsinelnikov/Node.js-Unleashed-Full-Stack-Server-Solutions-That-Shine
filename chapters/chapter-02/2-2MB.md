## Memory Boost: Routing, middleware, structure

Time to lock in those Express.js essentials! Answer these quick questions to solidify what you’ve learned. No pressure—just a fun way to boost your memory!

Read each question and try to answer it mentally or jot down your response. Use the hints to jog your memory if you’re stuck. This is a great way to check your understanding before moving to the next section.

1. 🛤️ Routing Dive<br />
   **What’s the purpose of `app.use('/users', userRoutes)` in the Express app?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s like assigning a specific “department” to handle all requests starting with `/users`!)*
   
2. 🔌 Middleware Power<br />
   **What do `express.json()`, `morgan('dev')`, and `helmet()` do in the app?**<br />
   *(Hint: One parses JSON, one logs requests, and one secures your app with HTTP headers!)*
   
3. 🕵️‍♂️ Custom Middleware<br />
   **How does the custom logging middleware in `app.js` work, and why is `next()` important?**<br />
   *(Hint: It logs the method, URL, and timestamp, but `next()` keeps the request moving!)*
   
4. 📁 Static Files<br />
   **What does `app.use(express.static('public'))` do, and when would you use it?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think serving images, CSS, or JavaScript files directly to the browser!)*
   
5. 🚨 Error Handling<br />
   **How does the error-handling middleware in `app.js` catch and respond to errors?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the last middleware with four parameters and sends a 500 error response!)*
   
6. 🚫 404 Not Found<br />
   **What happens when a request doesn’t match any route in the app?**<br />
   *(Hint: Look for the middleware that sends a 404 status with a JSON error message!)*

7. 🏗️ App Structure<br />
   **Why is it useful to separate routes into `userRoutes` in a file like `./routes/userRoutes`?**<br />
   *(Hint: It keeps `app.js` clean and makes the app easier to scale or maintain!)*

8. 🔒 Security with Helmet<br />
   **Why is `helmet()` included in the middleware stack?**<br />
   *(Hint: It protects your app by setting headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities!)*

9. 🌐 Express in Full-Stack<br />
   **Where does Express sit in a full-stack app?**<br />
   *(Hint: It connects frontend requests to database actions, handles APIs, and can even serve static files!)*

10. 🧪 Running the App<br />
   **How do you start your Express server and test it in the browser?**<br />
   *(Hint: Run it with `node server.js` or `npm run dev`, then open `http://localhost:3000`!)*
