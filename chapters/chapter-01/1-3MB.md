## Memory Boost: Modules, npm (Node Package Manager)

Recall the key steps in your Node.js adventure. No stress—just fun. Let's go!

1. **The Module System**<br />
   What does it mean for Node.js to use modules?<br />
   *(Hint: Think of them as reusable pieces of code that keep your project organized and efficient!)*
   
2. **Exporting Basics**<br />
   How does `module.exports` work in a Node.js file?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s how you share functions, objects, or variables with other files!)*
   
3. **Importing Basics**<br />
   What’s the role of `require()` in Node.js?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s how you bring in exported code from another file or package!)*
   
4. **Core Modules**<br />
   What are some built-in modules Node.js provides?<br />
   *(Hint: Consider `fs`, `http`, `path`, and `url`—tools for common tasks!)*
   
5. **Custom Modules**<br />
   Why create your own modules in Node.js?<br />
   *(Hint: They help split your code into small, focused parts that work well with the event loop!)*
   
6. **npm Overview**<br />
   What’s npm, and why is it important for Node.js?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the package manager that lets you add external libraries to your project!)*

7. **Installing Packages**<br />
   How do you add a package like Express with npm?<br />
   *(Hint: Run `npm install express`, and it’s added to `node_modules` for use!)*
