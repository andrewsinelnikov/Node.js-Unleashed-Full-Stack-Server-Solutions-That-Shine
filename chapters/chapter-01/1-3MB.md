## Memory Boost: Modules, npm

Recall the key steps in your Node.js adventure. No stress—just fun. Let's go!

1. 🧩 The Module System<br />
   **What does it mean for Node.js to use modules?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think of them as reusable pieces of code that keep your project organized and efficient!)*
   
2. 📤 Exporting Basics<br />
   **How does `module.exports` work in a Node.js file?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s how you share functions, objects, or variables with other files!)*
   
3. 📥 Importing Basics<br />
   **What’s the role of `require()` in Node.js?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s how you bring in exported code from another file or package!)*
   
4. 🛠 Core Modules<br />
   **What are some built-in modules Node.js provides?**<br />
   *(Hint: Consider `fs`, `http`, `path`, and `url`—tools for common tasks!)*
   
5. ✨ Custom Modules<br />
   **Why create your own modules in Node.js?**<br />
   *(Hint: They help split your code into small, focused parts that work well with the event loop!)*
   
6. 📦 npm Overview<br />
   **What’s npm, and why is it important for Node.js?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the package manager that lets you add external libraries to your project!)*

7. 🔽 Installing Packages<br />
   **How do you add a package like Express with npm?**<br />
   *(Hint: Run `npm install express`, and it’s added to `node_modules` for use!)*

8. 📋 The `package.json` File<br />
   **What’s the purpose of the `package.json` file?**<br />
   *(Hint: It stores your project’s details, dependencies, and scripts!)*

9. 🔗 Using Packages<br />
   **How do you use an npm-installed package in your code?**<br />
   *(Hint: Use `require()`—like `require('express')`—to include it!)*

10. 🌍 Global Installs<br />
   **What happens when you install an npm package globally?**<br />
   *(Hint: Use `-g` with `npm install`, and it’s available across your system!)*

11. ⚡ Async Support<br />
   **How do modules and npm enhance Node’s non-blocking design?**<br />
   *(Hint: They keep tasks lightweight, letting the event loop manage multiple operations!)*
