## Memory Boost: Modules, npm (Node Package Manager)

Recall the key steps in your Node.js adventure. No stress—just fun. Let's go!

1. **The Module System**<br />
   What does it mean for Node.js to use modules?<br />
   *(Hint: Think of them as reusable pieces of code that keep your project organized and efficient!)*
   
2. **Exporting Basics**<br />
   How does `module.exports` work in a Node.js file?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s how you share functions, objects, or variables with other files!)*
   
4. **One Thread, Endless Possibilities**<br />
   Why doesn’t Node.js’s single-threaded model slow it down?<br />
   *(Hint: Picture a solo chef with a team of prep cooks and a list called the event loop!)*
   
5. **I/O**<br />
   What kinds of tasks does non-blocking I/O handle like a champ?<br />
   *(Hint: Think databases, files, and API calls—anything that talks to the outside world!)*
   
6. **The Event Loop Dance**<br />
   What’s the secret that keeps Node.js’s single thread juggling thousands of tasks?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s a loop that never sleeps, always checking what’s ready to roll!)*
   
7. **When to Pump the Brakes**<br />
   What type of tasks might trip up Node.js’s single-threaded groove?<br />
   *(Hint: Think heavy math or video crunching that hogs the chef’s attention!)*
