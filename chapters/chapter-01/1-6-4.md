### Your Turn

[E-Commerce Storefront](1-6.md) || [Online Reservation System](1-6-2.md) || *Your Turn:* [Task Blaster](1-6-3.md) || Your Turn: **Fit Flair Tracker**

You’ve got the fundamentals under your belt—now it’s time to flex those Node.js muscles in a real-world app that brings wellness and backend logic together. Say hello to your next unleashed build: **Fit Flair Tracker**.

This isn’t about copying code. It’s about building something meaningful with **your** own logic, creativity, and precision. You’re the engineer behind a tool that helps users track fitness goals and habits—because even backend devs need good structure and routines.

> Build strong APIs. Build smart models. Build something you’d actually use.

### Portfolio Project 4: "Fit Flair Tracker"

Fit Flair Tracker is your personal wellness tracker—a purpose-built backend that empowers users to log workouts, set goals, and monitor their fitness journey over time. You’ll build the core of a system that tracks progress, filters activity logs, and keeps users accountable with persistent, goal-oriented data models.

**Why this project matters:**<br />
Health and fitness tracking isn’t just trendy—it’s a practical backend challenge involving user input, data analysis, and time-based tracking. By building a fitness tracker, you’ll sharpen your skills in structuring RESTful APIs, handling data relationships, and modeling user-centric features. This is the kind of project employers love to see in a portfolio.

**Project goals**

You’re building a personalized fitness tracking backend with the following core features:

- **Workout Creation** – Users should be able to log workouts, including type (e.g., cardio, strength), duration, and date.
- **Daily Log View** – Show a user’s workout history, with filtering by date or workout type.
- **Progress Tracking** – Add ability to update progress on goals (e.g., “Run 10km this week”).
- **Goal Setting** – Users can set fitness goals (e.g., “Workout 4x a week”) and track their status.
- **Data Persistence** – All data should be saved and retrieved using a database like MongoDB.
- **Bonus Features (Optional)** – Visualize weekly or monthly summaries; integrate habit tracking (like water intake, sleep, etc.)

**YOUR STARTING POINT**

Here’s how you can begin:

1. Project Setup
   - Create a new folder: mkdir fit-flair-tracker && cd fit-flair-tracker
   - Initialize the project: npm init -y
   - Install dependencies: (e.g. express, mongoose, nodemon, dotenv)
2. Plan Your API Routes
   - POST /workouts – Log a new workout
   - GET /workouts – Get all workouts (with optional filters)
   - POST /goals – Set a new fitness goal
   - PATCH /goals/:id – Update progress on a goal
   - GET /goals – View all goals and their status
        
By the end of this project, you won’t just know Node—you’ll know how to build backend systems with purpose. Put your own spin on it, and make it portfolio-worthy.

Let’s go. Track it. Build it. Make it flair.
