### Your Turn

[E-Commerce Storefront](1-6.md) || [Online Reservation System](1-6-2.md) || [Task Blaster (Your Turn)](1-6-3.md) || **Fit Flair Tracker (Your Turn)**

You’ve got the fundamentals under your belt—now it’s time to flex those Node.js muscles in a real-world app that brings wellness and backend logic together. Say hello to your next unleashed build: **Fit Flair Tracker**.

This isn’t about copying code. It’s about building something meaningful with **your** own logic, creativity, and precision. You’re the engineer behind a tool that helps users track fitness goals and habits—because even backend devs need good structure and routines.

> Build strong APIs. Build smart models. Build something you’d actually use.

**PROJECT BRIEF: Task Blaster**

Fit Flair Tracker is your personal wellness tracker—a purpose-built backend that empowers users to log workouts, set goals, and monitor their fitness journey over time. You’ll build the core of a system that tracks progress, filters activity logs, and keeps users accountable with persistent, goal-oriented data models.

**Why this project matters:**<br />
Health and fitness tracking isn’t just trendy—it’s a practical backend challenge involving user input, data analysis, and time-based tracking. By building a fitness tracker, you’ll sharpen your skills in structuring RESTful APIs, handling data relationships, and modeling user-centric features. This is the kind of project employers love to see in a portfolio.

**Project goals**

You’re building a basic task management app with these core features:

- **Task Creation** – Users should be able to create new tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Task Listing** – List all tasks, with optional filters (e.g., by status or priority).
- **Marking Tasks Complete** – Users should be able to toggle a task as complete/incomplete.
- **Deleting Tasks** – Let users remove tasks when they’re no longer needed.
- **Data Persistence** – Store all tasks in a database (MongoDB, for example).
- **Bonus Features (Optional)** – Categories, reminders, or recurring tasks.

**YOUR STARTING POINT**

Here’s how you can begin:

1. Project Setup
   - Create a new folder: mkdir task-blaster && cd task-blaster
   - Initialize the project: npm init -y
   - Install dependencies: (e.g. express, mongoose, nodemon, dotenv)
2. Plan Your API Routes
   - GET /tasks – List all tasks
   - POST /tasks – Create a new task
   - PATCH /tasks/:id – Update task (mark as complete, etc.)
   - DELETE /tasks/:id – Delete a task
        
By the time you’re done, you’ll not only have a stronger grasp on Node.js—but you’ll also have a unique, personal app to add to your portfolio.
