### Modules, npm (Node Package Manager)

In Node.js, **modules** are like building blocks that help you organize and reuse code efficiently. Imagine you’re still that chef in the restaurant. Instead of preparing every ingredient from scratch for every dish, you have pre-made sauces, chopped veggies, or spice mixes ready to go. Modules are those pre-made pieces—self-contained chunks of code you can pull into your project whenever you need them. It allows you to organize your code into smaller, manageable pieces, making it more maintainable and easier to debug.

Node.js uses a module system based on the **CommonJS** standard. Every file in Node.js is treated as a module by default, and you can export functionality from one file and import it into another. This keeps your codebase modular, clean, and easy to maintain. Here’s how it works:
