### Portfolio Project 2: "Online Reservation System"

[E-Commerce Storefront](1-6.md) || **Online Reservation System** || [File Logger Module](1-5-3.md) || [Multi-Route Greeting Server](1-5-4.md)

In this section, we’re going to take everything you’ve learned so far and apply it to build a real-world application—a fully functional Online Reservation System. This project will guide you through the process of creating a complete, production-ready web application that allows users to view available slots, make reservations, and manage bookings. By the end of this project, you’ll have a strong Node.js portfolio piece that demonstrates your ability to build efficient, event-driven, and scalable server-side applications.

**Why an Online Reservation System?**

Building an online reservation system is a fantastic way to master Node.js because it brings together several key development concepts, including:

- *User Interaction*: Letting users reserve a time slot, book a table, or schedule a service.
- *Dynamic Data Handling*: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting reservation data.
- *Authentication & Authorization*: Managing different roles (users vs. admins).
- *Real-Time Availability*: Reflecting current availability instantly when users make or cancel bookings.
- *Scalability*: Designing the system to handle multiple users making concurrent reservations.

Whether you're modeling a restaurant reservation system, a co-working space booking platform, or a salon appointment scheduler—this project equips you with core backend skills used across industries.

**What’s in Store for You?**

Throughout this project, you’ll progressively build out the features of the reservation system. Starting with a basic HTTP server, you'll move toward handling dynamic data and complex user flows. Along the way, you’ll learn how to:
Use asynchronous programming and non-blocking I/O; handle different HTTP routes and methods; build modular, scalable Node.js applications; store and manage data using a real database (MongoDB); add authentication and admin controls; enable real-time updates with WebSockets or polling.

**Goal:**<br />
Begin building the foundation of your Online Reservation System. In this first stage, you'll focus on creating a basic HTTP server using Node.js and setting up simple route handling. This sets the stage for more advanced features like booking logic, authentication, and data storage.

**What to do:**
- Set up the project folder and initialize the Node.js app.
- Create a basic HTTP server using Node’s built-in `http` module.
- Handle multiple routes like homepage (`/`), about page (`/about`), and a placeholder for booking (`/book`).
- Log every request with a timestamp to demonstrate the non-blocking, event-driven, single-threaded model in action.

**Let's code:**
1. Set up the Project<br />
   First, create a folder called `ecommerce-storefront` and navigate into it in your terminal. Then, create a file called `server.js`:
    ```bash
    mkdir ecommerce-storefront
    cd ecommerce-storefront
    touch server.js
    ```
2. Write the Code<br />
   Open `server.js` and add the following code to set up the basic server:

    ```javascript
    const http = require('http');
    
    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        // Log the request with a timestamp
        const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();
        console.log(`Request received at ${currentTime} for ${req.url}`);

        // Handle routing
        if (req.url === '/') {
            res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
            res.write('Welcome to the E-Commerce Store!');
        } else if (req.url === '/about') {
            res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
            res.write('This is the about page.');
        } else if (req.url === '/products') {
            res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
            res.write('Here are the products!');
        } else {
            res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
            res.write('404 - Page not found');
        }

        res.end();
    });

    const PORT = 3000;
    server.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
    });
    ```
3. Run the Server
   - In your terminal, navigate to the folder where `server.js` is located, then run the server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    You should see the message:
    ```
    Server is running on http://localhost:3000
    ```
   - Open your browser and visit:
     - `http://localhost:3000` to see the homepage message.
     - `http://localhost:3000/about` for the about page.
     - `http://localhost:3000/products` for the products page.
     - Any other URLs should return a `404` error.

At this stage, you've successfully created the foundation of your e-commerce storefront. You've set up a basic HTTP server that handles multiple routes, and you’ve logged each request to demonstrate the event-driven nature of Node.js. This project is just getting started, but you've laid the groundwork for handling basic HTTP requests and responses.
