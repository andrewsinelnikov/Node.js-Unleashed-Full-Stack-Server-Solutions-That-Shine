## Portfolio Project 2: "Online Reservation System"

[E-Commerce Storefront](1-6.md) || **Online Reservation System** || *Your Turn:* [Task Blaster](1-6-3.md) || *Your Turn:* [Fit Flair Tracker](1-6-4.md)

In this section, we’re going to take everything you’ve learned so far and apply it to build a real-world application—a fully functional Online Reservation System. This project will guide you through the process of creating a complete, production-ready web application that allows users to view available slots, make reservations, and manage bookings. By the end of this project, you’ll have a strong Node.js portfolio piece that demonstrates your ability to build efficient, event-driven, and scalable server-side applications.

### Why an Online Reservation System?

Building an online reservation system is a fantastic way to master Node.js because it brings together several key development concepts, including:

- *User Interaction*: Letting users reserve a time slot, book a table, or schedule a service.
- *Dynamic Data Handling*: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting reservation data.
- *Authentication & Authorization*: Managing different roles (users vs. admins).
- *Real-Time Availability*: Reflecting current availability instantly when users make or cancel bookings.
- *Scalability*: Designing the system to handle multiple users making concurrent reservations.

Whether you're modeling a restaurant reservation system, a co-working space booking platform, or a salon appointment scheduler—this project equips you with core backend skills used across industries.

### What’s in Store for You?

Throughout this project, you’ll progressively build out the features of the reservation system. Starting with a basic HTTP server, you'll move toward handling dynamic data and complex user flows. Along the way, you’ll learn how to:
Use asynchronous programming and non-blocking I/O; handle different HTTP routes and methods; build modular, scalable Node.js applications; store and manage data using a real database (MongoDB); add authentication and admin controls; enable real-time updates with WebSockets or polling.

**Goal:**<br />
Begin building the foundation of your Online Reservation System. In this first stage, you'll focus on creating a basic HTTP server using Node.js and setting up simple route handling. This sets the stage for more advanced features like booking logic, authentication, and data storage.

### What to do
- *Set up your project folder*: Create a folder for your reservation system and set up the main server file.
- *Create the HTTP Server*: Use Node’s built-in `http` module to build a basic server that listens for incoming requests.
- *Define Routes*: Set up simple routes for the homepage (`/`), about page (`/about`), and a placeholder for the booking page (`/book`).
- *Log Incoming Requests*: Implement a logging system to track each request with a timestamp—demonstrating Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven nature.

### Let's code
1. Set up the Project<br />
   Create a project folder called `reservation-system` and navigate into it:
   ```bash
      mkdir reservation-system
      cd reservation-system
      touch server.js
   ```
2. Write the Code<br />
   Open `server.js` and add the following code to set up the basic server:
   ```javascript
   // Import the built-in http module
   const http = require('http');

   // Define the server port
   const PORT = 3000;

   // Create the HTTP server
   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
     // Log every incoming request with a timestamp
     const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();
     console.log(`Request received at ${currentTime} for ${req.url}`);

     // Routing logic
     if (req.url === '/') {
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.write('Welcome to QuickReserve — your dream booking app!');
     } else if (req.url === '/about') {
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.write('QuickReserve allows users to book tables or appointments easily.');
     } else if (req.url === '/book') {
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.write('Booking page coming soon...');
     } else {
       res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.write('404 - Page not found');
     }

     // End the response
     res.end();
   });

   // Start listening on the defined port
   server.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
   });
   ```
3. Run the Server
   - Back in your terminal:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    You should see:
    ```
    Server is running on http://localhost:3000
    ```
   - Open your browser and visit:
     - `http://localhost:3000` → Welcome message
     - `http://localhost:3000/about` → App description
     - `http://localhost:3000/book` → Placeholder for bookings
     - `http://localhost:3000/anything-else` → 404 error
   - Each request logs something like:
   ```
      Request received at 4/10/2025, 2:15:45 PM for /
   ```
   
This foundational server is your starting point—your “host stand” in the reservation system! You created a basic Node.js server using the `http` module, handled basic route logic with `if-else` statements, implemented server-side logging to capture incoming requests. This gives you a strong foundation for building out features like booking forms, calendar availability, user logins, and database integration.
