## Hints for "Simple API for Calculations" Challenge

1. Use the http Module<br />
   Node.js has a built-in `http` module. Use `http.createServer()` to create the HTTP server.
2. Parse the URL for Query Parameters<br />
   Use `req.url` to get the incoming request's URL. You can use the built-in `URL` module (or `url.parse()` in older versions of Node) to parse the query string and extract the parameters `num1`, `num2`, and `operation`. The URL will be in the format: `/calculate?num1=5&num2=3&operation=add`.
3. Handle Basic Operations<br />
   After extracting the query parameters, convert `num1` and `num2` from strings to numbers using `parseFloat()` or `Number()`. Based on the value of the `operation` parameter, perform the requested mathematical operation (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, divide):
   - If `operation === 'add'`, return `num1 + num2`.
   - If `operation === 'subtract'`, return `num1 - num2`.
   - If `operation === 'multiply'`, return `num1 * num2`.
   - If `operation === 'divide'`, return `num1 / num2`, but make sure to handle division by zero!
4. Send the Response<br />
   Once the operation is performed, use `res.end()` to send back the result as a response in the format: `"5 + 3 = 8"`. If the operation is not recognized, respond with an appropriate error message like: `"Invalid operation"`.
5. Log Each Request<br />
   Use `console.log()` to log each incoming request. The log should include the timestamp (`new Date().toISOString()`) and the operation being requested, e.g., `"Request received at [timestamp] for operation: add"`.
6. Handle Edge Cases<br />
   Consider what happens if the query parameters are missing or invalid (e.g., no `num1` or `num2` provided). Make sure to handle cases like division by zero or invalid operations by responding with an error message such as `"Invalid input"` or `"Cannot divide by zero"`.
7. Keep It Simple<br />
   Focus on implementing just the basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) first. Once those are working, you can add extra features or validations, like checking for valid numbers or operations.
