**Mini Project 6: "Simple Contact Form Handler"**<br /> 
(*Section: Basic HTTP server*)

**Goal:** Create an HTTP server that responds with a simple JSON object when requested.

**What to do:**
- Build an HTTP server using the `http` module.  
- When a user visits `http://localhost:3000`, the server responds with a JSON object like:  
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Node.js App",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "status": "active"
     }
     ```  
- Log each request to the console, showing the timestamp and response status (e.g., "Request received at [time], responded with JSON").  
- This project will introduce you to JSON responses and reinforce how Node.js handles requests asynchronously.

**Let's code:**
1. Set up the Project
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Create a new folder for the project:
     ```bash
     mkdir simple-json-api
     cd simple-json-api
     ```
   - Initialize a new Node.js project by running:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```
   - In your project folder, create a file named `server.js`.
2. Write the Code
   ```javascript
   // server.js
   const http = require('http'); // Import the HTTP module to create a server

   // Define the server port
   const port = 3000;

   // Create the HTTP server
   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
     // Log the request with the current timestamp
     const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
     console.log(`Request received at ${timestamp}, responding with JSON`);

     // Set the response header to indicate a JSON response
     res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });

     // Define the JSON object to send
     const responseObject = {
       name: "Node.js App",
       version: "1.0.0",
       status: "active"
     };

     // Send the JSON object as the response
     res.end(JSON.stringify(responseObject));  
   });

   // Start the server and listen on the specified port
   server.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```
   **Explanation of Key Concepts**
   - Building an HTTP server with Node.js, we can send a response back to the client (like a web browser or another application) in various formats. In this project, we want to send a JSON response. In the code, we define a JavaScript object:
   ```javascript
   const responseObject = {
     name: "Node.js App",
     version: "1.0.0",
     status: "active"
   };
   ```
   In this case, responseObject is turned into a JSON string that looks like this:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Node.js App",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "status": "active"
   }
   ```
   - To send this JavaScript object as a JSON response, we need to convert it into a JSON-formatted string. This is done using JSON.stringify() (this method converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string. The resulting string can be sent over HTTP as a response)
   ```javascript
   res.end(JSON.stringify(responseObject));
   ```
   - When sending a JSON response, it is important to let the client know that the data being sent is in JSON format. This is achieved by setting the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` in the response:
   ```javascript
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
   ```
   
3. Run the Server
   - To start the server, open your terminal in the project directory and run:
   ```bash
     node server.js
   ```
   - This will start the server, and it will be listening on `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Test the Server<br />
   - Open your browser and visit the following URL:
   ```bash
     http://localhost:3000
   ```
   - You should see the following JSON response:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Node.js App",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "status": "active"
   }
   ```
   - In your terminal, you should see a log similar to:
   ```javascript	
     Request received at 2025-03-29T12:34:56.789Z, responding with JSON
   ```

This project demonstrates how to create a basic HTTP server using Node.js' built-in `http` module, how to respond with a JSON object.
