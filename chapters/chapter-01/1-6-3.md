### Your Turn

[E-Commerce Storefront](1-6.md) || [Online Reservation System](1-6-2.md) || Your Turn: **Task Blaster** || *Your Turn:* [Fit Flair Tracker](1-6-4.md)

Now that you’ve unlocked the fundamentals of Node.js, it’s time to **unleash** your skills with a challenge that puts **you** in the developer’s seat. Meet your next challenge: **Task Blaster**.

This isn't just a follow-along exercise—this is your moment to architect, code, and launch a real-world app using everything you’ve learned. In this unleashed build, you’ll bring your own ideas to life while solving real backend problems that matter.

> Think like a product developer. Build like a full-stack problem solver. <br /> You’ve got this. Let’s blast through it.

### Portfolio Project 3: "Task Blaster"

Task Blaster is your custom-built task management tool—a sleek backend that helps users organize their life, one task at a time. You’ll design and build the server-side logic, shape the data flow, and store it all with persistent data models.

**Why this project matters:**<br />
Task management apps are everywhere—and building one from scratch teaches you how to juggle CRUD operations, route design, and data modeling like a pro. Plus, it’s highly customizable, making it the perfect canvas to show off your backend brilliance.

**Project goals**

You’re building a basic task management app with these core features:

- **Task Creation** – Users should be able to create new tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Task Listing** – List all tasks, with optional filters (e.g., by status or priority).
- **Marking Tasks Complete** – Users should be able to toggle a task as complete/incomplete.
- **Deleting Tasks** – Let users remove tasks when they’re no longer needed.
- **Data Persistence** – Store all tasks in a database (MongoDB, for example).
- **Bonus Features (Optional)** – Categories, reminders, or recurring tasks.

**YOUR STARTING POINT**

Here’s how you can begin:

1. Project Setup
   - Create a new folder: mkdir task-blaster && cd task-blaster
   - Initialize the project: npm init -y
   - Install dependencies: (e.g. express, mongoose, nodemon, dotenv)
2. Plan Your API Routes
   - GET /tasks – List all tasks
   - POST /tasks – Create a new task
   - PATCH /tasks/:id – Update task (mark as complete, etc.)
   - DELETE /tasks/:id – Delete a task
        
By the time you’re done, you’ll not only have a stronger grasp on Node.js—but you’ll also have a unique, personal app to add to your portfolio.
