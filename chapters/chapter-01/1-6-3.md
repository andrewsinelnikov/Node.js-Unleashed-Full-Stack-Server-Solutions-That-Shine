### Your Turn

[E-Commerce Storefront](1-6.md) || [Online Reservation System](1-6-2.md) || **Task Blaster (Your Turn)** || [Fit Flair Tracker (Your Turn)](1-6-4.md)

Now that you’ve unlocked the fundamentals of Node.js, it’s time to **unleash** your skills with a challenge that puts **you** in the developer’s seat. Meet your next challenge: **Task Blaster**.

This isn't just a follow-along exercise—this is your moment to architect, code, and launch a real-world app using everything you’ve learned. In this unleashed build, you’ll bring your own ideas to life while solving real backend problems that matter.

> Think like a product developer. Build like a full-stack problem solver. <br /> You’ve got this. Let’s blast through it.

**PROJECT BRIEF: Task Blaster**

Task Blaster is your custom-built task management tool—a sleek backend that helps users organize their life, one task at a time. You’ll design and build the server-side logic, shape the data flow, and store it all with persistent data models.

**Why this project matters:**<br />
Task management apps are everywhere—and building one from scratch teaches you how to juggle CRUD operations, route design, and data modeling like a pro. Plus, it’s highly customizable, making it the perfect canvas to show off your backend brilliance.

**PROJECT GOALS**

You’re building a basic task management app with these core features:

- **Task Creation** – Users should be able to create new tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Task Listing** – List all tasks, with optional filters (e.g., by status or priority).
- **Marking Tasks Complete** – Users should be able to toggle a task as complete/incomplete.
- **Deleting Tasks** – Let users remove tasks when they’re no longer needed.
- **Data Persistence** – Store all tasks in a database (MongoDB, for example).
- **Bonus Features (Optional)** – Categories, reminders, or recurring tasks.

**Goal:**<br />
Begin building the foundation of your Online Reservation System. In this first stage, you'll focus on creating a basic HTTP server using Node.js and setting up simple route handling. This sets the stage for more advanced features like booking logic, authentication, and data storage.

**What to do:**
- *Set up your project folder*: Create a folder for your reservation system and set up the main server file.
- *Create the HTTP Server*: Use Node’s built-in `http` module to build a basic server that listens for incoming requests.
- *Define Routes*: Set up simple routes for the homepage (`/`), about page (`/about`), and a placeholder for the booking page (`/book`).
- *Log Incoming Requests*: Implement a logging system to track each request with a timestamp—demonstrating Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven nature.

**Let's code:**
1. Set up the Project<br />
   Create a project folder called `reservation-system` and navigate into it:
   ```bash
      mkdir reservation-system
      cd reservation-system
      touch server.js
   ```
2. Write the Code<br />
   Open `server.js` and add the following code to set up the basic server:
   ```javascript
   // Import the built-in http module
   const http = require('http');

   // Define the server port
   const PORT = 3000;

   // Create the HTTP server
   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
     // Log every incoming request with a timestamp
     const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();
     console.log(`Request received at ${currentTime} for ${req.url}`);

     // Routing logic
     if (req.url === '/') {
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.write('Welcome to QuickReserve — your dream booking app!');
     } else if (req.url === '/about') {
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.write('QuickReserve allows users to book tables or appointments easily.');
     } else if (req.url === '/book') {
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.write('Booking page coming soon...');
     } else {
       res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.write('404 - Page not found');
     }

     // End the response
     res.end();
   });

   // Start listening on the defined port
   server.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
   });
   ```
3. Run the Server
   - Back in your terminal:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    You should see:
    ```
    Server is running on http://localhost:3000
    ```
   - Open your browser and visit:
     - `http://localhost:3000` → Welcome message
     - `http://localhost:3000/about` → App description
     - `http://localhost:3000/book` → Placeholder for bookings
     - `http://localhost:3000/anything-else` → 404 error
   - Each request logs something like:
   ```
      Request received at 4/10/2025, 2:15:45 PM for /
   ```
   
This foundational server is your starting point—your “host stand” in the reservation system! You created a basic Node.js server using the `http` module, handled basic route logic with `if-else` statements, implemented server-side logging to capture incoming requests. This gives you a strong foundation for building out features like booking forms, calendar availability, user logins, and database integration.
