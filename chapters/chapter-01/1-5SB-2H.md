## Hints for "Simple Time Server" Challenge

1. Use the http Module<br />
   The `http` module is built into Node.js. Use `http.createServer()` to create an HTTP server.
2. Get the Current Date and Time<br />
   Inside the request handler, use `new Date().toISOString()` to get the current date and time in a readable format. This will be the server time you respond with.
3. Send the Server Time in the Response<br />
   Use `res.end()` to send a response back to the user. The response should include the current date and time, e.g., *"Current server time is: [current_time]"*.
4. Log Each Request<br />
   For every incoming request, log the timestamp of when the request was received and the time that is being sent in the response. Use `console.log()` for logging. You can format the log like: *"Request received at [timestamp], responding with time: [current_time]"*.
5. Keep It Simple<br />
   Start by focusing on responding with the server time and logging the requests. Once that's working, test it by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and checking the console for logs.
