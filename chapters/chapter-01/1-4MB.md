## Memory Boost: Basic HTTP Server

Recall the key steps in your Node.js adventure. No stress—just fun. Let's go!

1. The HTTP Module<br />
   **What’s the role of the `http` module in Node.js?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the built-in tool that lets you cook up a web server and handle requests like a pro!)*
   
2. Creating a Server<br />
   **How do you use `http.createServer()` to start your server?**<br />
   *(Hint: It takes a callback that fires every time a customer, request—walks in, handing you req and res to work with!)*
   
3. Request Object (req)<br />
   **What does the `req` argument in the callback tell you?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s like the customer’s order slip—think URL, method, and more!)*
   
4. Response Object (res)<br />
   **What’s the job of the res argument in the callback?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s how you serve up the dish—status codes, headers, and the response body!)*
   
5. Setting the Status<br />
   **What does res.writeHead() do when crafting a response?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s like setting the table—status code and headers, like 200 for “OK” and content type!)*
   
6. Sending a Response<br />
   **How does res.write() contribute to your server’s reply?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the main course—the actual content you send back to the browser!)*

7. Finishing the Response<br />
   **Why is res.end() so important?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the “check, please!” moment—tells the browser you’re done serving!)*

8. **The package.json File**<br />
   What’s the purpose of the `package.json` file?<br />
   *(Hint: It stores your project’s details, dependencies, and scripts!)*

9. **Using Packages**<br />
   How do you use an npm-installed package in your code?<br />
   *(Hint: Use `require()`—like `require('express')`—to include it!)*

10. **Global Installs**<br />
   What happens when you install an npm package globally?<br />
   *(Hint: Use `-g` with `npm install`, and it’s available across your system!)*

11. **Async Support**<br />
   How do modules and npm enhance Node’s non-blocking design?<br />
   *(Hint: They keep tasks lightweight, letting the event loop manage multiple operations!)*
