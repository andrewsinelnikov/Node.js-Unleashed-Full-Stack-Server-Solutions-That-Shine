## Memory Boost: Basic HTTP Server

Recall the key steps in your Node.js adventure. No stress—just fun. Let's go!

1. The HTTP Module<br />
   **What’s the role of the `http` module in Node.js?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the built-in tool that lets you cook up a web server and handle requests like a pro!)*
   
2. Creating a Server<br />
   **How do you use `http.createServer()` to start your server?**<br />
   *(Hint: It takes a callback that fires every time a customer, request—walks in, handing you req and res to work with!)*
   
3. Request Object (req)<br />
   **What does the `req` argument in the callback tell you?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s like the customer’s order slip—think URL, method, and more!)*
   
4. Response Object (res)<br />
   **What’s the job of the res argument in the callback?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s how you serve up the dish—status codes, headers, and the response body!)*
   
5. Setting the Status<br />
   **What does res.writeHead() do when crafting a response?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s like setting the table—status code and headers, like 200 for “OK” and content type!)*
   
6. Sending a Response<br />
   **How does res.write() contribute to your server’s reply?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the main course—the actual content you send back to the browser!)*

7. Finishing the Response<br />
   **Why is res.end() so important?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the “check, please!” moment—tells the browser you’re done serving!)*

8. Listening on a Port<br />
   **What does server.listen() do, and why pick a port like 3000?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s like opening your restaurant doors at a specific address so customers can find you!)*

9. Event-Driven System<br />
   **How does the HTTP server tie into Node’s non-blocking nature?**<br />
   *(Hint: Requests trigger events, and the event loop keeps the kitchen humming without waiting around!)*

10. Handling Routes<br />
   **How can you use req.url to serve different responses?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s like a menu—check the URL and dish out “homepage,” “about,” or a 404 if they order off-menu!)*

11. Status Codes<br />
   **What’s the difference between a 200 and a 404 status code?**<br />
   *(Hint: 200 says “Here’s your order!” while 404 says “Sorry, we don’t have that!”)*

12. Running the Server<br />
   **What command do you type in the terminal to launch your server.js file?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s as simple as node server.js—fires up your restaurant for business!)*
