## Memory Boost: Basic HTTP Server

Recall the key steps in your Node.js adventure. No stress—just fun. Let's go!

1. **The HTTP Module**<br />
   What’s the role of the http module in Node.js?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the built-in tool that lets you cook up a web server and handle requests like a pro!)*
   
2. **Creating a Server**<br />
   How do you use http.createServer() to start your server?<br />
   *(Hint: It takes a callback that fires every time a customer, request—walks in, handing you req and res to work with!)*
   
3. **Importing Basics**<br />
   What’s the role of `require()` in Node.js?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s how you bring in exported code from another file or package!)*
   
4. **Core Modules**<br />
   What are some built-in modules Node.js provides?<br />
   *(Hint: Consider `fs`, `http`, `path`, and `url`—tools for common tasks!)*
   
5. **Custom Modules**<br />
   Why create your own modules in Node.js?<br />
   *(Hint: They help split your code into small, focused parts that work well with the event loop!)*
   
6. **npm Overview**<br />
   What’s npm, and why is it important for Node.js?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s the package manager that lets you add external libraries to your project!)*

7. **Installing Packages**<br />
   How do you add a package like Express with npm?<br />
   *(Hint: Run `npm install express`, and it’s added to `node_modules` for use!)*

8. **The package.json File**<br />
   What’s the purpose of the `package.json` file?<br />
   *(Hint: It stores your project’s details, dependencies, and scripts!)*

9. **Using Packages**<br />
   How do you use an npm-installed package in your code?<br />
   *(Hint: Use `require()`—like `require('express')`—to include it!)*

10. **Global Installs**<br />
   What happens when you install an npm package globally?<br />
   *(Hint: Use `-g` with `npm install`, and it’s available across your system!)*

11. **Async Support**<br />
   How do modules and npm enhance Node’s non-blocking design?<br />
   *(Hint: They keep tasks lightweight, letting the event loop manage multiple operations!)*
