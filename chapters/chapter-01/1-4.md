### Basic HTTP server

**A web server** is a software application that serves web pages to users over the internet. When you visit a website in your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, which processes the request and sends back the appropriate web page (usually as an HTML document) or other data.

Node.js makes it really easy to create a web server using the built-in `http` module. This module allows you to handle HTTP requests and send HTTP responses. This is one of the most fundamental use cases of Node.js—think of it as setting up a little restaurant where customers (HTTP requests) come in, and you (the server) serve them food (responses).

**How to can create a basic HTTP server:**

1. **Require the `http` Module**: Just like you used `fs` or your custom `car.js` module, you’ll import the `http` module using `require()`.
2. **Create a Server**: Use `http.createServer()` to set up a server. This method takes a callback function that runs every time a request hits the server. The callback gets two arguments: `req` (the request object) and `res` (the response object).
3. **Handle Requests**: Inside the callback, you define what happens when a request comes in—e.g., sending back a simple message.
4. **Start Listening**: Tell the server to listen on a specific port (like 3000) so it can receive requests.
