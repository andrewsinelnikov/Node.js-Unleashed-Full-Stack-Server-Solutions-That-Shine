### Basic HTTP server

**A web server** is a software application that serves web pages to users over the internet. When you visit a website in your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, which processes the request and sends back the appropriate web page (usually as an HTML document) or other data.

Node.js makes it really easy to create a web server using the built-in `http` module. This module allows you to handle HTTP requests and send HTTP responses. This is one of the most fundamental use cases of Node.js—think of it as setting up a little restaurant where customers (HTTP requests) come in, and you (the server) serve them food (responses).

**How to can create a basic HTTP server:**

1. **Require the `http` Module**: Just like you used `fs` or your custom `car.js` module, you’ll import the `http` module using `require()`.
2. **Create a Server**: Use `http.createServer()` to set up a server. This method takes a callback function that runs every time a request hits the server. The callback gets two arguments: `req` (the request object) and `res` (the response object).
3. **Handle Requests**: Inside the callback, you define what happens when a request comes in—e.g., sending back a simple message.
4. **Start Listening**: Tell the server to listen on a specific port (like 3000) so it can receive requests.

Let’s create a basic server that responds with "Hello, [Your Dream App]!" when you visit it in your browser. Create a file called `server.js` and add this code:

```javascript
// server.js
const http = require('http');

// Create the server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set the response status code and headers
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  // Send the response body
  res.write('Hello, [Your Dream App]!');
  // End the response
  res.end();
});

// Start the server on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```
**Running the Server:**
1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `server.js`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where `server.js` is located.
3. Run the server by typing:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. You should see the message `Server is running on http://localhost:3000`.
5. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the text "Hello, [Your Dream App]!" displayed in your browser.

**Breaking It Down**
- **`require('http')`**: Imports the built-in `http` module, one of those core modules you learned about.
- **`http.createServer((req, res) => {...})`**  method takes a function that gets called every time a request is made to the server. This function receives two arguments::
  - `req`: Represents the incoming request. It contains details like the URL, HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), and headers.
  - `res`: Represents the response you’ll send back. You use it to set status codes, headers, and the response body.
- **`res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })`**:
  - `200`: The HTTP status code for "OK" (success).
  - `'Content-Type': 'text/plain'`: Tells the browser the response is plain text (not HTML or JSON).
- **`res.write()`**: Sends the body of the response (the message "Hello, [Your Dream App]!").
- **`res.end()`**: Signals that the response is complete. Without this, the request would hang.
- **`server.listen(3000, ...)`**: Starts the server on port 3000 and logs a message when it’s ready. Ports are like "doors" on your computer that the server listens on—3000 is a common choice for development.

This server is event-driven and non-blocking. When a request comes in, the `http.createServer` callback is triggered as an event. Node’s event loop handles it without waiting for the response to finish—it just moves on to the next event (like another request). This keeps the server lightweight and efficient, even if you get lots of requests at once.

**Adding Some Spice: Handling Different Routes**

Right now, the server responds the same way no matter what URL you visit. Let’s make it a bit smarter by responding differently based on the URL. Update `server.js` like this:

```javascript
// server.js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Check the requested URL
  if (req.url === '/') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.write('Welcome to the homepage!');
  } else if (req.url === '/about') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.write('This is the about page.');
  } else {
    res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.write('404 - Page not found');
  }
  res.end();
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```
In this version:
- **`req.url`**: This property of the `req` object tells you the path the user requested (e.g., `/` for the root or `/about`).
- **Conditional Logic**: Based on the URL, we send different responses. If the URL doesn’t match anything, we return a 404 (Not Found) status.<br />
Try it out:
- `http://localhost:3000/` → "Welcome to the homepage!"
- `http://localhost:3000/about` → "This is the about page."
- `http://localhost:3000/anything-else` → "404 - Page not found"

This basic HTTP server is a good starting point for building more complex web applications with Node.js.
