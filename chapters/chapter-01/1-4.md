### Basic HTTP server

**A web server** is a software application that serves web pages to users over the internet. When you visit a website in your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, which processes the request and sends back the appropriate web page (usually as an HTML document) or other data.

Node.js makes it really easy to create a web server using the built-in `http` module. This module allows you to handle HTTP requests and send HTTP responses. This is one of the most fundamental use cases of Node.js—think of it as setting up a little restaurant where customers (HTTP requests) come in, and you (the server) serve them food (responses).
