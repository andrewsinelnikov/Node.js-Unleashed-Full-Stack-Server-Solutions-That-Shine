**Mini Project 3: "File Logger Module"**<br /> 
(*Section: Modules, npm*)

**Goal:** Simulate a restaurant order system that processes orders without blocking.

**What to do:**
- Create an HTTP server with a `GET /order` route.
- When a request hits `/order`, simulate a delayed task (e.g., cooking) using `setTimeout` (mimicking I/O delay) and respond with "Order received, preparing..." immediately.
- After 2 seconds, log "Order ready!" to the console (simulating an event callback), but don’t block the server—prove it can handle more requests during the delay.
- Test it by opening multiple browser tabs to `/order` and watching the logs.

**Let's code:**
1. Set up the Project
   - Create a folder for your project, for example, order-tracker-server.
   - Inside that folder, create a file named server.js (this will be the main file for our server).
2. Write the Code
   ```javascript
      // Import the http module to create the server
      const http = require('http');

      // Define the port where the server will listen
      const port = 3000;

      // Create the HTTP server
      const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        // If the request is for the /order route
        if (req.url === '/order' && req.method === 'GET') {
          // Immediately respond that the order is being prepared
          res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
          res.write('Order received, preparing...');
          res.end();

          // Simulate a delayed task (cooking) with a timeout
          setTimeout(() => {
            console.log('Order ready!');
          }, 2000);
        } else {
          // If the route is not /order, return a 404
          res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
          res.write('Page not found');
          res.end();
        }
      });

      // Start the server and listen for incoming requests on port 3000
      server.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
      });
   ```
3. Run the Server
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you created the server.js file.
   - Run the server by executing:
   ```bash 
	   node server.js
   ```
   You should see the following message:
   ```arduino
       Server is running on http://localhost:3000
   ```
4. Test the Server<br />
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/order`. You should see the message:
   ```vbnet
	Order received, preparing...
   ```   
   (This is the immediate response.)
   
   - After 2 seconds, you should see the following in your terminal log:
   ```swift
	Order ready!
   ```
   - Open multiple browser tabs and visit `http://localhost:3000/order` in each one. Each time you refresh or visit the `/order` route, you should see the immediate response in all tabs. The terminal will log "Order ready!" for each order after a 2-second delay, proving the server can handle multiple requests without blocking.

This project highlights the event-driven model (responding to requests as events), non-blocking I/O (not waiting for the "cooking" to finish), and single-threaded efficiency (handling multiple orders on one thread).
