In this section, we're going to apply the key concepts of Node.js that we've learned so far through a series of mini-projects. Each of these projects will help you understand how to leverage the power of Node.js for building simple, yet effective, web applications.

### Mini Project 1: "Dream App Welcome Server"

*<p align="center"><a href="1-4.md">(Section: Basic HTTP server)</a></p>*

**Goal:** Create a simple server that showcases Node.js as a runtime for your "dream app."  

**What to do:**
- Build an HTTP server using the `http` module.
- When someone visits `http://localhost:3000`, it responds with a motivational message like: "Welcome to [Your Dream App]—powered by Node.js, turning ideas into reality!"
- Use the single-threaded, event-driven nature by logging each request to the console with a timestamp (e.g., "Request received at [time]").

**Let's code:**
1. Set up the Project
   - Create a folder where your project will reside, for example, dream-app-server.
   - Inside that folder, create a file named server.js (this will be the main file for our server).
2. Write the Code
   ```javascript
   // Import the http module to create the server
   const http = require('http');

   // Define the port where the server will listen
   const port = 3000;

   // Create the HTTP server
   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
      // Log each request with a timestamp to showcase the event-driven nature of Node.js
      const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();
      console.log(`Request received at ${currentTime}`);

      // Set the response headers (HTTP status code and content type)
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });

      // Send a motivational message in the response
      res.write('Welcome to My Dream App—powered by Node.js, turning ideas into reality!');

      // End the response
      res.end();
   });

   // Start the server and listen for incoming requests on port 3000
   server.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```
3. Run the Server
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you created the server.js file.
   - Run the server by executing:
   ```bash 
	   node server.js
   ```
   You should see the following message:
   ```arduino
       Server is running on http://localhost:3000
   ```
4. Test the Server<br />
   Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000. You should see the motivational message:
   ```vbnet
	Welcome to [Your Dream App]—powered by Node.js, turning ideas into reality!
   ```
   Every time you refresh the page or visit the server, you should see a new log entry in the terminal with the request timestamp, like:
   ```swift
	Request received at 3/25/2025, 10:00:00 AM
   ```

This project demonstrates Node.js's event-driven architecture by reacting to each incoming request as an event. Its non-blocking I/O ensures that each request is handled without waiting for others, and single-threaded efficiency is evident as multiple requests are processed on the same thread, one after the other
