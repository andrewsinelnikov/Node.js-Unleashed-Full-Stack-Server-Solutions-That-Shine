In this section, we're going to apply the key concepts of Node.js that we've learned so far through a series of mini-projects. Each of these projects will help you understand how to leverage the power of Node.js for building simple, yet effective, web applications.

#### Mini Project 1: "Dream App Welcome Server"

**Goal:** Create a simple server that showcases Node.js as a runtime for your "dream app."  
**What to do:**
- Build an HTTP server using the `http` module.
- When someone visits `http://localhost:3000`, it responds with a motivational message like: "Welcome to [Your Dream App]—powered by Node.js, turning ideas into reality!"
- Use the single-threaded, event-driven nature by logging each request to the console with a timestamp (e.g., "Request received at [time]").
