#### Challenge 4: "Simple API for Calculations"

**Goal:** Create an HTTP server that performs basic mathematical operations based on URL parameters.

**What to do**:  
- Set up an HTTP server using the `http` module.  
- When someone visits `http://localhost:3000/calculate?num1=5&num2=3&operation=add`, the server performs the requested operation and returns the result (e.g., "5 + 3 = 8").  
- Log each request with the timestamp and the parameters (e.g., "Request received at [time] for operation: add").  
- This project reinforces working with query parameters, handling basic logic, and responding with simple data.
