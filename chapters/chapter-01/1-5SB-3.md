#### Challenge 3: "Real-Time Visitor Counter"

**Goal:** Build a server that tracks and displays the number of visitors who have accessed your server.

**What to do**:  
- Create an HTTP server using the `http` module.  
- Every time a user visits `http://localhost:3000`, the server increments a counter and responds with a message like: "You are visitor number [counter]."  
- Log each request to the console with a timestamp (e.g., "Request received at [time], current visitor count: [counter]").  
- This will help reinforce the idea of handling concurrent requests and logging activity, while also illustrating the event-driven nature of Node.js.
