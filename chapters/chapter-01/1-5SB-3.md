## Hints for "Real-Time Visitor Counter" Challenge

1. Use the http Module<br />
   Node.js has a built-in `http` module. You can use `http.createServer()` to create your HTTP server.
2. Create a Counter Variable<br />
   Before creating the server, create a variable to track the number of visitors. This could be something like `let visitorCount = 0;`.
3. Handle Requests and Increment the Counter<br />
   Inside your server's request handler, every time a request is received, increment the visitorCount by 1. You can use the req parameter in your server's callback function to handle the incoming request.
4. Respond with Visitor Number<br />
   Use `res.end()` to send a response back to the user. Include the visitor number in the response message, for example: *"You are visitor number [visitorCount]."*
5. Log Requests with a Timestamp<br />
   Log each incoming request to the console. Use `console.log()` to display the current timestamp (`new Date().toISOString()`) along with the current visitor count. You can format it like: *"Request received at [timestamp], current visitor count: [visitorCount]"*.
6. Handle Multiple Requests<br />
   Remember that every new request from a user will trigger your server. Ensure that the visitor count is incremented each time, and that each request is logged properly.
7. Keep It Simple<br />
   Focus on making the basic counter and logging functionality work first. You can always add more features later, such as resetting the counter or handling additional routes.
