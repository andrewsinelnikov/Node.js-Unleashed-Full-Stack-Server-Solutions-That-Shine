### Portfolio Project

**E-Commerce Storefront** || [Event-Driven Order Tracker](1-5-2.md) || [File Logger Module](1-5-3.md) || [Multi-Route Greeting Server](1-5-4.md) || [Simple JSON API Server](1-5-5.md) || [Simple Contact Form Handler](1-5-6.md)

In this section, we’re going to take everything you’ve learned so far and apply it to build a real-world application—a full-fledged E-Commerce Storefront. This project will guide you through the process of building a complete, production-ready web application that includes all the essential features you'd find in an online store, from user authentication to product listings and order management. By the end of this section, you’ll have a solid portfolio project to showcase your Node.js skills and demonstrate your ability to build robust web applications.

**Why an E-Commerce Storefront?**

Building an e-commerce site is a fantastic way to practice and master Node.js because it involves several core concepts, such as:

- *User Authentication*: Handling buyer, seller, and admin accounts securely.
- *CRUD Operations*: Adding, updating, and deleting products, orders, and user profiles.
- *Payment Integration*: Processing transactions using services like Stripe or PayPal.
- *Real-Time Data*: Updating order statuses, inventories, and reviews instantly.
- *Scaling*: Building a system that can grow from a small app to something enterprise-level.

**What’s in Store for You?**

Throughout this section, you'll progressively build up the functionality of the site, working towards a fully functional e-commerce platform. Each step of the way, you'll integrate essential features and best practices like asynchronous programming, handling HTTP requests, connecting to databases, and creating modular applications.

#### Portfolio Project 1: "E-Commerce Storefront"

**Goal:** Begin building the foundational elements of your E-Commerce Storefront. Focus on setting up a basic HTTP server using Node.js, and create the skeleton of the store’s backend. This includes handling basic routes and responses, and setting the stage for the more complex features that will be added later (like user authentication, product listings, and order management).

**What to do:**
- *Set up your project folder*: Create a folder for your e-commerce project. Inside it, you'll set up the necessary files, like your main server file (`server.js`).
- *Create the HTTP Server*: Use the built-in `http` module to create a basic server that listens for incoming requests and sends responses.
- *Create Routes*: Define routes for the basic pages like the homepage (`/`), about page (`/about`), and a placeholder  for the products page (`/products`).
- *Log Requests*: Set up logging for incoming requests to demonstrate the event-driven nature of Node.js.

**Let's code:**
1. Set up the Project<br />
   First, create a folder called `ecommerce-storefront` and navigate into it in your terminal. Then, create a file called `server.js`:
    ```bash
    mkdir ecommerce-storefront
    cd ecommerce-storefront
    touch server.js
    ```
2. Write the Code<br />
   Open `server.js` and add the following code to set up the basic server:

    ```javascript
    const http = require('http');
    
    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        // Log the request with a timestamp
        const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();
        console.log(`Request received at ${currentTime} for ${req.url}`);

        // Handle routing
        if (req.url === '/') {
            res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
            res.write('Welcome to the E-Commerce Store!');
        } else if (req.url === '/about') {
            res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
            res.write('This is the about page.');
        } else if (req.url === '/products') {
            res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
            res.write('Here are the products!');
        } else {
            res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
            res.write('404 - Page not found');
        }

        res.end();
    });

    const PORT = 3000;
    server.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
    });
    ```
3. Run the Server
   - In your terminal, navigate to the folder where `server.js` is located, then run the server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    You should see the message:
    ```
    Server is running on http://localhost:3000
    ```
   - Open your browser and visit:
     - `http://localhost:3000` to see the homepage message.
     - `http://localhost:3000/about` for the about page.
     - `http://localhost:3000/products` for the products page.
     - Any other URLs should return a `404` error.

At this stage, you've successfully created the foundation of your e-commerce storefront. You've set up a basic HTTP server that handles multiple routes, and you’ve logged each request to demonstrate the event-driven nature of Node.js. This project is just getting started, but you've laid the groundwork for handling basic HTTP requests and responses.
