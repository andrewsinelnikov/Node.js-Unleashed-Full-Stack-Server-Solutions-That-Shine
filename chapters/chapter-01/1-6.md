### Portfolio Project

**E-Commerce Storefront** || [Event-Driven Order Tracker](1-5-2.md) || [File Logger Module](1-5-3.md) || [Multi-Route Greeting Server](1-5-4.md) || [Simple JSON API Server](1-5-5.md) || [Simple Contact Form Handler](1-5-6.md)

In this section, we’re going to take everything you’ve learned so far and apply it to build a real-world application—a full-fledged E-Commerce Storefront. This project will guide you through the process of building a complete, production-ready web application that includes all the essential features you'd find in an online store, from user authentication to product listings and order management. By the end of this section, you’ll have a solid portfolio project to showcase your Node.js skills and demonstrate your ability to build robust web applications.

**Why an E-Commerce Storefront?**

Building an e-commerce site is a fantastic way to practice and master Node.js because it involves several core concepts, such as:

    - *User Authentication*: Handling buyer, seller, and admin accounts securely.
    - *CRUD Operations*: Adding, updating, and deleting products, orders, and user profiles.
    - *Payment Integration*: Processing transactions using services like Stripe or PayPal.
    - *Real-Time Data*: Updating order statuses, inventories, and reviews instantly.
    - *Scaling*: Building a system that can grow from a small app to something enterprise-level.

#### Mini Project 1: "Dream App Welcome Server"

**Goal:** Create a simple server that showcases Node.js as a runtime for your "dream app."  

**What to do:**
- Build an HTTP server using the `http` module.
- When someone visits `http://localhost:3000`, it responds with a motivational message like: "Welcome to [Your Dream App]—powered by Node.js, turning ideas into reality!"
- Use the single-threaded, event-driven nature by logging each request to the console with a timestamp (e.g., "Request received at [time]").

**Let's code:**
1. Set up the Project
   - Create a folder where your project will reside, for example, dream-app-server.
   - Inside that folder, create a file named server.js (this will be the main file for our server).
2. Write the Code
   ```javascript
   // Import the http module to create the server
   const http = require('http');

   // Define the port where the server will listen
   const port = 3000;

   // Create the HTTP server
   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
      // Log each request with a timestamp to showcase the event-driven nature of Node.js
      const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleString();
      console.log(`Request received at ${currentTime}`);

      // Set the response headers (HTTP status code and content type)
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });

      // Send a motivational message in the response
      res.write('Welcome to My Dream App—powered by Node.js, turning ideas into reality!');

      // End the response
      res.end();
   });

   // Start the server and listen for incoming requests on port 3000
   server.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```
3. Run the Server
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you created the server.js file.
   - Run the server by executing:
   ```bash 
	   node server.js
   ```
   You should see the following message:
   ```arduino
       Server is running on http://localhost:3000
   ```
4. Test the Server<br />
   Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000. You should see the motivational message:
   ```vbnet
	Welcome to [Your Dream App]—powered by Node.js, turning ideas into reality!
   ```
   Every time you refresh the page or visit the server, you should see a new log entry in the terminal with the request timestamp, like:
   ```swift
	Request received at 3/25/2025, 10:00:00 AM
   ```

This project demonstrates Node.js's event-driven architecture by reacting to each incoming request as an event. Its non-blocking I/O ensures that each request is handled without waiting for others, and single-threaded efficiency is evident as multiple requests are processed on the same thread, one after the other
