#### Challenge 2: "Simple Time Server"

**Goal:** Create an HTTP server that responds with the current date and time.

**What to do**:  
- Build an HTTP server using the `http` module.  
- When someone visits `http://localhost:3000`, the server responds with the current date and time (e.g., "Current server time is: [current_time]").  
- Log each request to the console, showing the timestamp and the server time being sent (e.g., "Request received at [time], responding with time").  
- This project will reinforce the concept of real-time responses and logging.
