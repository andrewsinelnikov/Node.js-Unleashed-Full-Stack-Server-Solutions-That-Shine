## Memory Boost: Event-driven, non-blocking I/O, and single-threaded model

Recall the key steps in your Node.js adventure. No stress—just fun. Let's go!

1. 🎭 The Event Maestro<br />
   **What does it mean for Node.js to be "event-driven"?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think of a chef juggling orders, reacting to sizzling steaks and ready salads instead of waiting around!)*
   
2. 🚀 No Waiting, Just Doing<br />
   **How does non-blocking I/O make Node.js so speedy?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s like ordering coffee and letting the barista work while you chat with a friend—no standing still!)*
   
3. 🧵 One Thread, Endless Possibilities<br />
   **Why doesn’t Node.js’s single-threaded model slow it down?**<br />
   *(Hint: Picture a solo chef with a team of prep cooks and a list called the event loop!)*
   
4. 🌐 I/O<br />
   **What kinds of tasks does non-blocking I/O handle like a champ?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think databases, files, and API calls—anything that talks to the outside world!)*
   
5. 💃 The Event Loop Dance<br />
   **What’s the secret that keeps Node.js’s single thread juggling thousands of tasks?**<br />
   *(Hint: It’s a loop that never sleeps, always checking what’s ready to roll!)*
   
6. 🛑 When to Pump the Brakes<br />
   **What type of tasks might trip up Node.js’s single-threaded groove?**<br />
   *(Hint: Think heavy math or video crunching that hogs the chef’s attention!)*
