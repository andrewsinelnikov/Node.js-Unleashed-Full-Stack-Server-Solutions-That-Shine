## Memory Boost: Event-driven, non-blocking I/O, and single-threaded model

Recall the key steps in your Node.js adventure. No stress—just fun. Let's go!

1. **The Event Maestro**<br />
   What does it mean for Node.js to be "event-driven"?<br />
   *(Hint: Think of a chef juggling orders, reacting to sizzling steaks and ready salads instead of waiting around!)*
   
2. **No Waiting, Just Doing**<br />
   How does non-blocking I/O make Node.js so speedy?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s like ordering coffee and letting the barista work while you chat with a friend—no standing still!)*
   
3. **One Thread, Endless Possibilities**<br />
   Why doesn’t Node.js’s single-threaded model slow it down?<br />
   *(Hint: Picture a solo chef with a team of prep cooks and a list called the event loop!)*
   
7. **Lean, Mean, and Ready to Scale**<br />
   Why is Node.js perfect for apps with tons of users—like an online store or a fitness tracker?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s all about handling thousands of requests without breaking a sweat!)*

8. **Big Dreams, Big Players**<br />
   Which famous companies rely on Node.js to power their apps?<br />
   *(Hint: Think streaming, networking, and ride-sharing giants!)*

9. **Tools at Your Fingertips**<br />
   What makes building with Node.js even easier?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s an ecosystem full of ready-to-use libraries—just a download away!)*
