## Memory Boost: Event-driven, non-blocking I/O, and single-threaded model

Recall the key steps in your Node.js adventure. No stress—just fun. Let's go!

1. **The Event Maestro**<br />
   What does it mean for Node.js to be "event-driven"?<br />
   *(Hint: Think of a chef juggling orders, reacting to sizzling steaks and ready salads instead of waiting around!)*
   
2. **No Waiting, Just Doing**<br />
   How does non-blocking I/O make Node.js so speedy?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s like ordering coffee and letting the barista work while you chat with a friend—no standing still!)*
   
3. **One Thread, Endless Possibilities**<br />
   Why doesn’t Node.js’s single-threaded model slow it down?<br />
   *(Hint: Picture a solo chef with a team of prep cooks and a list called the event loop!)*
   
4. **I/O**<br />
   What kinds of tasks does non-blocking I/O handle like a champ?<br />
   *(Hint: Think databases, files, and API calls—anything that talks to the outside world!)*
   
5. **The Event Loop Dance**<br />
   What’s the secret that keeps Node.js’s single thread juggling thousands of tasks?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s a loop that never sleeps, always checking what’s ready to roll!)*
   
11. **Tools at Your Fingertips**<br />
   What makes building with Node.js even easier?<br />
   *(Hint: It’s an ecosystem full of ready-to-use libraries—just a download away!)*
