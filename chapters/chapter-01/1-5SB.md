#### Challenge 1: "Simple Personal Portfolio Server"

**Goal:** Create a simple HTTP server that serves your personal portfolio or homepage.  

**What to do**:  
- Build an HTTP server using the `http` module.  
- When someone visits `http://localhost:3000`, the server responds with a personalized welcome message (e.g., "Welcome to [Your Name]'s Portfolio").  
- Log each request to the console with a timestamp and the URL path the user is visiting (e.g., "Request received at [time] for [path]").  
- Optionally, you can add different routes like `/about`, `/projects`, and `/contact` to simulate a basic multi-page portfolio.
